        <p>
            Panix is a small, hobbyist kernel started by <a href="https://github.com/Kfeavel">Keeton Feavel</a> and further
            developed with the help of <a href="https://github.com/micahswitzer">Micah Switzer</a>.
            Having now undergone three rewrites from the ground up, Panix has come a long way since its first start in 2018.

        <h3 id="design-philosophy">Design Philosophy</h3>
        <p>
            Panix is designed to be readable first and foremost. Having been developed at
            <a href="https://cs.cedarville.edu">Cedarville University</a>, the primary goal of Panix is to provide an
            opportunity for students (and anyone else interested) to learn the intricacies of kernel development. Function
            names are descriptive and structs are used when possible in order to help increase the legibility of code and
            provide an &quot;easy-in&quot; for kernel development.
        </p>
        <h3 id="accomplishments">Accomplishments</h3>
        <p>
            Panix is the subject of an independent study and the associated final report published by Keeton Feavel at
            Cedarville and used by Patrick Dudenhofer to help instruct students of CS-3320 (Operating Systems). The
            <code>cedarville</code> branch is an older, modified version of the Panix kernel used as a template for
            assignments designed to help introduce concepts such as CPU ports and hardware communication. Eventually, once
            paging is fully implemented, another assignment will be developed to help explain paging and memory management.

        <p>
            We are constantly looking for people to help contribute to Panix. If you would like to contribute driver code or
            a new feature, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request. If you are a student who would like
            to get involved, feel free to contact any of the project contributors.
